# Portfolio Website

This is my own personal portfolio website that I have created to display my CV in an almost interactive format. It also showcases my level of web development experience.

Currently still being worked on until each section has been filled out with information. Also a place to test out new frameworks to help improve my web development knowledge and being able to create websites a lot more efficiently.
